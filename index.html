          Treaty No. 1 was signed on August 3, 1871, at
          <span> Lower Fort Garry </span> in North Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was
          the first of the Numbered Treaties between the Canadian government and
          Indigenous peoples. This treaty involved the Anishinaabe and Swampy
          Cree nations of southern Manitoba. The agreement stated that specific
          lands to the Crown was in exchange for various commitments, including
          the reserve lands, payments, and other benefits to the Indigenous
          groups.

          Treaty One is made up of many Indigenous communities in southern
          Manitoba. These communities represent the
          <span> Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree </span>
          Nations. In particular, the Saulteaux (a division of the Anishinaabe),
          Swampy Cree, and Ojibwe peoples signed the treaty. The historic
          actions Indigenous communities took then still affect the land we're living
          on today. Many of us fail to realize/ take for granted the land we
          live on.
