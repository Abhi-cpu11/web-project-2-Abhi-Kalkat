        <h2>What is Treaty One?</h2>
        <p>
          Treaty No. 1, signed on August 3, 1871, at
          <span> Lower Fort Garry </span> in Manitoba, was the first of the
          Numbered Treaties between the Canadian government and Indigenous
          peoples. This treaty involved the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree nations
          of southern Manitoba. The agreement outlined the cession of specific
          lands to the Crown in exchange for various commitments, including the
          provision of reserve lands, annuities, and other benefits to the
          Indigenous signatories.
