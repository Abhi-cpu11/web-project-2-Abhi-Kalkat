          Treaty No. 1 was signed on August 3, 1871, at
          <span> Lower Fort Garry </span> in North Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was
          the first of the Numbered Treaties between the Canadian government and
          Indigenous peoples. This treaty involved the Anishinaabe and Swampy
          Cree nations of southern Manitoba. The agreement stated that specific
          lands to the Crown was in exchange for various commitments, including
          the reserve lands, payments, and other benefits to the Indigenous
          groups.

        <p tabindex="">
          Treaty 1 was signed in 1871 between the Canadian government and seven First Nations groups. Some of the key terms in the Treaty included land, money, and other promises. Each Indigenous family of five was promised 160 acres of land, which breaks down to 32 acres per person. The government also promised to give them farming tools, animals, and money to help them move into farming. On top of that, there were “outside promises” not written in the original treaty document. These included clothing, ammunition, and a yearly payment of five dollars per person. In hindsight, $5 back then had a lot more value compared to what $5 is worth in today's economy.

        <!--Paragraph explaining what makes it different from other treaties-->
        <p tabindex="5">
          Treaty 1 is different from some other treaties because it was the first numbered treaty signed after Manitoba joined Canada. It also set the tone for future treaties. But many people from Treaty 1 say that they didn’t agree to give up their land forever. They believed they were sharing the land, not surrendering it. This misunderstanding led to a lot of problems later on. Furthermore, the Treaty was written in English, and many Indigenous leaders didn’t speak or read English. This made it hard for them to fully understand what they were signing.

        <!--Paragraph explaining what treaty one is-->
        <p tabindex="5">
          Treaty 1 is still important today and is recognized by Canadian law under the Constitution Act, 1982. This means the government still has a legal duty to respect the promises made in the Treaty. One way Treaty 1 is being put into action is through urban reserves. These are pieces of land inside cities that are owned and run by First Nations. For example, the Treaty One Nation is developing the Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg into a huge urban reserve. It will include housing, businesses, and green space. This project gives First Nations more control over their land and helps their communities grow economically. Another way Treaty 1 is being implemented is through agreements that support Indigenous education, health care, and business opportunities. Some Treaty 1 First Nations are also using treaty rights to take part in decisions about land and resources.
