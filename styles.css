/*
Color Palette Explanation:
I chose a monochromatic green color family because it connects to the land, 
nature, growth, and balance which is exactly what this website is about.
Since it’s focused on Treaty One, I wanted the whole site to feel peaceful, 
grounded, and natural. Green represents life, renewal, and harmony, and using different shades of it ties everything back to the land and the message behind the Treaty. 
The primary dark green (#102316) is used for the most important stuff like the nav bar, 
footer, titles, and main body text. It’s deep and bold, which makes it feel strong and reliable. 
I wanted the core of the site to feel stable, like the roots of a tree. It’s also used on half 
of the clickable link to keep that grounded tone going. The light green (#a6b174) is used for the main background. It’s soft and relaxing, and it helps 
everything else pop without feeling too bright. It’s basically the foundation layer that supports 
everything visually without being distracting. The mid green (#385534) is kind of the middle ground, it adds structure. I used it for headings, 
links, the image container, the dashed line divider, and the border around the "subscribe now" 
section. It's also on the other half of the clickable link. It gives just enough contrast to 
separate things without clashing. It’s good for stuff that’s important, but not the main focus.
For neutral colors, I went with white for the divs so content is super clear and easy to read. 
It gives good contrast against the greens and keeps the site from feeling too dark. Then there’s 
beige (#e9dfc3), which I used in the outer background. It also brings a historic tone that fits 
with the natural theme.In conclusion, everything stays consistent and easy to look at. The green theme ties it all back 
to the land and gives off the exact peaceful, clean, grounded, and professional vibe I was going for.
