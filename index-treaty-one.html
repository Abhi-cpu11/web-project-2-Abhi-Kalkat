          <p tabindex="">
            Treaty 1 was signed in 1871 between the Canadian government and
            seven First Nations groups. Some of the key terms in the Treaty
            included land, money, and other promises. Each Indigenous family of
            five was promised 160 acres of land, which breaks down to 32 acres
            per person. The government also promised to give them farming tools,
            animals, and money to help them move into farming. On top of that,
            there were “outside promises” not written in the original treaty
            document. These included clothing, ammunition, and a yearly payment
            of five dollars per person. In hindsight, $5 back then had a lot
            more value compared to what $5 is worth in today's economy.

            What makes Treaty 1 different from other Treaties in Canada?

          <!--Paragraph explaining what makes it different from other treaties-->
          <p tabindex="5">
            Treaty 1 is different from some other treaties because it was the
            first numbered treaty signed after Manitoba joined Canada. It also
            set the tone for future treaties. But many people from Treaty 1 say
            that they didn’t agree to give up their land forever. They believed
            they were sharing the land, not surrendering it. This
            misunderstanding led to a lot of problems later on. Furthermore, the
            Treaty was written in English, and many Indigenous leaders didn’t
            speak or read English. This made it hard for them to fully
            understand what they were signing.

          <h2 tabindex="4">How is Treaty 1 implemented today?</h2>
          <!--Paragraph explaining what treaty one is-->
          <p tabindex="5">
            Treaty 1 is still important today and is recognized by Canadian law
            under the Constitution Act, 1982. This means the government still
            has a legal duty to respect the promises made in the Treaty. One way
            Treaty 1 is being put into action is through urban reserves. These
            are pieces of land inside cities that are owned and run by First
            Nations. For example, the Treaty One Nation is developing the
            Kapyong Barracks site in Winnipeg into a huge urban reserve. It will
            include housing, businesses, and green space. This project gives
            First Nations more control over their land and helps their
            communities grow economically. Another way Treaty 1 is being
            implemented is through agreements that support Indigenous education,
            health care, and business opportunities. Some Treaty 1 First Nations
            are also using treaty rights to take part in decisions about land
            and resources.
